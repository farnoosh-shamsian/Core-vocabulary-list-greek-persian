# Core-vocabulary-list-greek-persian
The original one is problematic because the separator is semicolon, which has already been used in the texts. 
The tab-separated version is working. Edits and updates are only done on the tab-separated version.
For details on creation of the list and other versions see: http://dcc.dickinson.edu/greek-core-list
